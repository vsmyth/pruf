            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>
                <strong> </strong></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;The day is clear, with a warm sun lighting the shopfronts on the opposite side of the street. In the comfortable shade on the lower side, Anne walks casually down the sidewalk, enjoying a light breeze as she walks into small street-front gallery. Her eye is attracted to a contemporary scene rendered in deeply textured oils, and her glasses paint the small PRüF enabled QR code on the frame’s corner a fluorescent green. As she briefly stares at the dotted symbol,  an image of the artist’s bio superimposes itself onto the lower right quarter of the frame along with a brief video as he coyly discusses the inspiration of his work. Mildly annoyed, she silences the video with a gesture and other information about the piece dominates the viewport. The painting is for sale (big surprise there, she muses) and the price is listed at 700. Impasto. That’s the word she was looking for. That kind of painting is ‘impasto’.</p><p>&nbsp;Being a little over her budget for retro-art paintings, she browses around a bit more before lazily drifting back out to the street. Looks like that wall above the sofa is staying blank for now. Walking further down, she happens upon an open air exhibition with some pleasant but unoriginal work—more of the same-old-same, with even a still life of fruit (who would buy that?) on display. She does a double take before looking back at a tranquil oriental-style river scene, comfortingly unremarkable yet possessing a certain serenity that she enjoys.</p><p>&nbsp; Pleasantly surprised when a very reasonable price appears along with no annoying video, she imagines that this is probably the thousandth time that the faceless artist has painted that scene, identical yet lovingly original in each of its iterations. Exactly what she was looking for, a mood but not a conversation piece.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Quickly purchasing the item with a swipe of her hand, she passes the delivery information to the merchant with her electronic payment, pending delivery. She watches as the price is replaced in the AR view with “purchased, delivery with escrow”. A small sound and buzz emanates from the sellers pocket, and he takes an ancient iPhone out and reviews the purchase. Her eyes warm, savoring the picturesque scene of the wrinkled man squinting at the screen in his hand.  He smiles, pleasant if slightly practiced, at Anne and dips his head, reaching over to the brown paper roll as he begins to package the painting for travel. She smiles back, wondering if he doesn't speak Portuguese, or if maybe he just pretends not to—something that she feels she could relate to if she were in his shoes. Later this afternoon, she will receive the painting at her flat. when she does, she will confirm the receipt and the escrow funds will be released to the seller. She wonders if she should put an outrageous price on the painting now, just in case someone really wants it... but no. Too tacky. She hates when she goes to someones house and everything is for sale.</p><p>&nbsp;Almost tripping on her waistcoat, she bumps gently into an adorable magenta scooter parked along the street. Oh, wow, its a Tespa! She has seen these new ones around quite a bit these days, but she hasn't taken the time to see one up close and personal yet. With a battery that would last her a week of daily use and an advanced maneuvering assistant, these cute little vehicles are all the hotness for style, economy, and safety in a commuter bike. Curious, she focuses briefly on the umlaut in the center of the ID sticker, but the words “privately owned” are all that is displayed. With a subtle flicking gesture, a context menu of “for sale near you”  zooms into view hovering over the sticker. There are two within a kilometer, but looking at the prices, she sighs and selects “notify me of new listings under 6235”, a preset she uses that provides her with notifications for 75% or less of the relevant price.</p><p>&nbsp;Making her way towards her favorite spot at the park, near that one street vendor with the empanadas from heaven (or is it really heaven, with all its wicked temptation?). Bending to sit at her favorite bench, she muses about whether or not she should put a reward on her “phone” as she feels the coldness of the bench soaking up through her coat. She “lost” it yesterday, but she’s starting to think maybe it was lifted from her pocket? Not that she really needs it anyway, but being kind of old fashioned (but definitely not a hipster, she told herself reassuringly), she still carried one. There was something just a little more real about looking at words on a screen instead of reading them floating in mid-air.</p><p>&nbsp;Anne thought to herself that maybe she should let that habit go anyway. No one from her generation (or her mother’s) or really, hardly anyone - except wrinkled old men and anachronistic types -  used phones, but she decided to set 19.9997 as the reward instead That would cover the network fees to an even 20. She went into the myStuff app (she still used MyStuff, even though the interface was a little dated, and there were much more modern PRüF wallets) and selected her phone with a subtle pinching motion, flicking it up onto the center of her view. She quickly changed the status of the sleek rectangle to “lost’, and enabled a “reward if returned” flag.</p><p>&nbsp;Chastising herself for being careless, she cringed over her embarrassment in thinking someone had taken it. No one did that anymore, except out of pure malice. What would you do with a stolen thing anyway? No one will buy it, unless you can somehow change the serial numbers – and even then, an unlisted, used item? Pretty suspicious. I guess you might be able to sell the parts, but at that point, who would bother?</p><p>&nbsp;Birds chirped overhead, (at least Anne was pretty sure they were real birds) as she watched two children playing what seemed to be a game of tag around a grassy mound. Wistfully drifting between thoughts, she was startled when a voice came from just beside her. It was Martim. He was a little late, of course, but she expected that.</p><p>&nbsp;“Oh, hi, I was just wondering where you were!” she said. (she wasn’t, but she wanted him to think she was) “You owe me 20.” smiled Martim. “What?” “Just kidding. You left this relic at my house yesterday, thought you might want it…” with a sudden recollection, a playfully feigned puzzlement was written across her brow.  Martim continued: “I saw you put a reward on it... you really are a luddite, you know that?” “Oh thanks..” she said, mildly amused at herself and rising to her feet—Martim wasn't wrong, really. As they walked together towards the river, a tourist gondola was sliding silently by on the other side.  They paused, near the riverbank, at the faux-rust stained railing. Taking in the scene, a moment of silence ensued as the boat passed, a sun worn older gentleman adjusting his glasses at the bow of the narrow craft. As if on que, they turned toward each other as the beautifully painted transom of the boat came into view. Looking away to the river, Martim said, with a hint of a smile, “forget the twenty, you can buy us a pizza”.</p></div>
