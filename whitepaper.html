        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine a</strong> <strong>world</strong>&nbsp;where your possessions and assets are provably and privately yours via a title on the blockchain. A world where lost or stolen items have little to no resale value, and where lost items come home on their own. Imagine effortless commerce, where selling something is as easy as marking it “for sale” in your wallet, or where finding a seller for something you see in the wild is as easy as choosing “for sale near me” in an app. Imagine purchasing a one of a kind item through the window of a closed local boutique and having the item show up later at your door, like magic. Imagine, without cost or effort, enabling local and global e-commerce for every “mom-and-pop” store, eschewing market giants for diversity, and truly democratized front door access to the marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine a better world with PRüF.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Right now, it can be difficult for private buyers or resellers to be sure if an item being sold is genuinely owned by the seller. Existing systems facilitate the resale of stolen goods, while PRüF does the opposite.</strong></p><p>PRüF Secure-Transfer allows a buyer to be sure that the person in front of them is the actual owner of the item being sold. Using Secure-Transfer also protects the buyer by documenting the release of rights to the item, as well as the (optional) immediate transfer of rights on the blockchain to the buyer. PRüF Private-Provenance reduces the incentive for property theft, as stolen items can be marked as stolen or lost once their absence is noted by the rights holder. This makes it very difficult to sell the stolen or lost item, because a free cursory search on any PRüF portal will indicate that item is lost or reported stolen.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>If something of yours is lost or stolen, there is often little you can do to retrieve it, but PRüF gives you secure and simple options.</strong></p><p>If a PRüF trust-enabled asset goes missing, it can be marked by the rights holder as being lost or stolen, and optionally linked with a mechanism for a reward if returned (while facilitating secure contact of the rights holder*.) PRüF trust-enabled assets are difficult to sell if stolen, because checking if an item is lost or stolen is easy, fast, and free. It will become part of reasonable due diligence by dealers, pawn shops, or private buyers to support PRüF trust-enabled assets.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The rights holder to a lost or stolen item can register return instructions with a PRüF boomerang return service provider*. The lost or stolen status and the reward will then be visible for anyone checking the provenance of the item after finding it, or before purchasing it from someone else, making the stolen item very difficult to sell. Even in a fringe case, the resale value would be lowered substantially, and thieves or finders would be required to expose their identities to claim any reward.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Alternatively, a rights holder could set a price on the item. A finder could then pay that price, on-chain, and have the asset ownership transferred to them through an escrow contract on the PRüF platform.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any special terms of recovery can be made available on the items PRüF listing, so that the owner can tailor the conditions of return for the best possible outcome.</span></p><p>You could, of course, also choose to do nothing, discard the item, or mark it as transferred in cases where that was the best choice.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>‘Registration’ as it is known today is privacy-eroding and creates ancillary risks from private or government entities. PRüF private-provenance eliminates this risk, even for the most sensitive of assets.</strong></p><p>PRüF private-provenance allows records to be stored such that ONLY the true owner can prove ownership. When using the private-provenance feature, Names or identifying information cannot be looked up in the system, cross referenced, or tracked. Additionally, items cannot be looked up in the PRüF protocol without the actual item serial number. For additional privacy, a ‘secret’ can also be included in the item record, creating a stealth listing, so that only the holder of the secret passphrase/PIN etc.  can look up the item at all.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">With PRüF private-provenance, no sensitive information is actually stored at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A cryptographic derivative “shadow” of the original data is stored, but it is impossible to recreate the original data from this shadow, because the original information is destroyed. Sensitive information is not only encrypted, it is simply not stored at all. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A rights holder of a PRüF trust-enabled asset can easily prove ownership by demonstrating that their name**, ID**, and secret creates the same key as was stored previously. Only this specific combination of information, known only to the rights holder, can produce this key.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Even if recovered, stolen items today will often not be returned to the owner without adequate documentation of ownership. Even in cases of theft where the item has been located, the possessor is usually assumed to be the owner unless additional proof is available.</strong></p><p>PRüF private-provenance allows a rights holder to prove the legitimacy of their claim, tracing the possession of the item back to a specific point in time or the original sale, irrefutably.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tokenized Real-world Assets</strong></p><p>Acting as a “title” to everyday goods, PRüF enabled tokenized assets allow the protections of title to extend to all of your personal valuables. PRüF private-provenance allows rights holders to securely hold, transfer, sell, and collateralize their possessions without opening their lives to scrutiny. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">In addition to everyday items, collectibles, heirlooms, and capital goods under personal ownership, PRüF enabled tokenized assets open up a multitude of options for discreet and protected asset ownership. In this model, major assets would be held and managed by a holding company. The executive advantages of ownership, without risk exposure, could be controlled by the token. This could range from real properties, boats, aircraft, and vehicles, to fixed fungible assets, such as a safe deposit box of gold coins.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A truly democratized, local-first global MarketSpace with PRüF</strong></p><p>PRüF enabled tokenized assets are linkable to automatically generated or customized item profiles. These profiles can include manufacturer provided information for mass produced items, or artisan profiles and introductions for hand crafted goods. Each PRüF enabled item bears a unique identifier, that can be (optionally) tied to this profile. As such, counterfeit goods are easily identifiable as false.</p><p>For mass produced goods, this information would likely include model number or series, documentation or manuals, instructional materials, feature demonstrations, etc.  For artisanal goods, the profile could link back to the artist, other work she has available, a wikipedia page, or other information. In any case, this link can be represented on a QR code or an NFC tag that can then be attached to or placed alongside the item as a sticker, tag, or label—or even built into the item in the case of RFID. The PRüF data tag indicates that there may be information available about the item, and that it will be very difficult to sell (or use in some cases) if stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>PRüF enabled tokenized assets align perfectly as an opportunity for partnering with a marketplace integrator, to create a local-first global marketplace. Such an integrator would have the opportunity of blending existing industry-scale supply chains with a local marketplace of pre-owned and artisanal items, leveraging the advantages of proximity marketing with deep supply and distribution backing. With effortless point of exposure shopping and deep brand integration possibilities, we expect this opportunity to be an attractive option for e-commerce at scale.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does a “PRüFed” world look like?</strong></p><p>By scanning a PRüF data tag (or even just looking at it, with AR glasses) data that the owner may have chosen to make public can be displayed. If the owner does not wish the tag to link to anything, something like “private” might be displayed instead.  If the item is for sale, price and sale information will be displayed along with the item info, giving the viewer the option to immediately enter into a purchase escrow to reserve the item if that option has been made available by the seller.</p><p>In this way, using only cheap-to-print QR codes(which can be created for fractions of a cent each), any seller or private individual can effortlessly “list” their items on a local-first global marketplace. When examining an item that is not for sale, a potential buyer could search “similar items near me” for example, and local listings for similar or identical items could be provided as options, backed up by listings from major suppliers and distributors. For the system to maximize throughput, local listings would be given top visibility so that users would be incentivized to provide “advertising” by displaying and listing their items in the system. This alignment of incentives allows for the integration of a local-first marketplace with global reach and pre-established distribution chains.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Counterfeit goods confuse consumers, cost sales, and erode brand value. Unfortunately, many sales channels(especially online channels) are not incentivized to care.</strong></p><p>With PRüF trust-enabled assets, its never been easier or more cost effective to protect your customers from fakes. With an individual asset ID for each genuine product, a quick scan the PRüF app verifies that the item is genuine and the ID unused. If a brand pirate tries to make asset ID’s, they will show up as fake. If they try to reuse a real number, it will show up as used after the first customer registers that number on the platform.  PRüF trust-enabled adds value and a premium nuance to your product, while reducing the threat of brand theft at a nominal unit cost, and with very little technology or equipment investment.</p><p>In the store, your customer can scan the PRüF trust-enabled tag or label with their phone. Since the item being verified is real, it will show up as “Genuine, unowned”. After purchase, your customer can open the sealed certificate included with the item, and enter the number inside using our app or your website. The item is then registered as “owned”, and the customer may then register themselves as the owner. For nontrivial items, the customer then enjoys all of the protections of a PRüF trust-enabled asset.&nbsp;</p><p>For online sales, the vendor can include the PRüF trust-enabled tag of the specific item purchased as an image on the invoice prior to shipping. Clicking through, your customer will get verification of authenticity, mark the item as owned, and can be brought to a product anticipation section of your brand’s website. This will provide an opportunity for additional customer education, brand promotion, social media generation, and additional sales opportunities. After receiving their purchase, your customer can open the sealed certificate and enter the number inside using our app or your website. The item is then registered as “owned”, and the customer may then register themselves as the owner of their new PRüF trust-enabled asset.&nbsp;</p><p>After the sale, onboarding, registration, and subsequent verification of the authenticity of the item can generate valuable insights for your brand, and help onboard 2nd or later party owners, bringing them to your website and giving your brand an opportunity to impress again, offer service contracts or upgrades, or enable other valuable customer interactions.</p><p>PRüF can offer all of this as a very low barrier, turnkey solution or can give you the tools to fully integrate authenticity verification into your online presence with no blockchain development required. PRüF is so easy and affordable to implement that it makes blockchain enabling your product as accessible to Individual creators as it is to fortune 500 brands. For appropriate projects, we may partner with your team to create a bespoke PRüF solution for your brand’s asset provenance needs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Counterfeit currency, fraud, and cash theft are rampant global problems. PRüF can help.</strong></p><p>Beyond falsified goods, as many as one in 40 currency notes are estimated to be counterfeit in some major western economies. This amounts to significant friction losses in legitimate economies by criminal actors, and the situation can be much worse in the developing world. PRüF verify can track larger denomination currency notes on the blockchain, so that serial numbers on bills can be scanned (at no cost) at the point of sale by vendors, with a smartphone by individuals, or at any point in the supply chain by banks, mints, and reserves. If a bill being scanned is marked as “held” by some other entity such as a bank, store, or other cash business, it can be considered questionable and returned to the bearer or more closely examined. If there is a question about the validity of a note, it can be referred to a bank or the appropriate agency for further inspection. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">All of this can be done with privacy and anonymity provided by the PRüF verify protocol, keeping cash as cash.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Potentially, even private parties could use PRüF to secure their holdings.  If a bill “held” in your wallet is stolen, it can be marked as stolen in PRüF verify and be made much harder to pass to someone else. When you wish to spend your bill, just scan it out of your wallet, marking it spent, and the accepting party will see that it is clean and safe to accept. Commodification of AR via smart glasses and related technology will streamline this process—bills with questionable provenance or known counterfeits could simply show up as red in an augmented reality display as device sensors read and look up the serial number in real time.</p><p>With the adoption of PRüF verify, Passing fake or stolen money just got a lot harder, and avoiding getting stuck with a counterfeit or stolen note becomes easier than ever.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Currency “locking” with PRüF verify can disincentivize theft for cash businesses.</strong></p><p>Robbery and theft are common pain points for nearly all cash businesses. Using PRüF verify, a business that uses cash could run each bill through an inexpensive scanner, automatically verifying each bill and marking it as “held” by the business. As part of the deposit process, bills would be scanned out of inventory and accepted into the inventory of the bank taking the deposit. For high risk locations, cash drawers or overhead camera systems could be adapted to scan high value bills in or out automatically.</p><p>Each step of the way, all bills are accounted for, and any missing bills could be made very difficult to use, marked as stolen by a trusted entity, rendering theft or robbery nearly pointless for a very small cost. Aligning incentives against malicious actors makes dollars and sense, and private and public insurances will be quick to recognize these advantages.</p><p>Theft, counterfeiting, and fraud levy an illegitimate shadow tax on societies. The PRüF verify protocol enables pervasive counterfeit detection and theft prevention by aligning incentives within an economy and reducing friction losses caused by malicious actors. This in turn lowers insurance costs, security infrastructure costs, enforcement costs, and a host of other zero return inefficiencies that result from these malignant expenditures. Using the PRüF verify protocol can improve outcomes in disadvantaged economic sectors by making cash safer, more secure, and less costly. Lower costs means lowering the barrier to entry for entrepreneurs, translating to improved growth, less crime, and healthier economies, benefiting all of us.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Read More about PRüF at our <a href="page4.html" class="text-primary">GitHub</a></p></div>
